## Overview

MovIDE is a browser-based IDE for Move programming, supporting Movement and SUI. It enables seamless compiling, building, and deploying of Move packages on-chain with no setup required. Like Remix for Solidity, MovIDE offers a dedicated Move development experience, with the unique ability to load packages directly from GitHub or on-chain sources for effortless deployment.

MovIDE is an online Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that redefines Move programming for blockchain networks such as Movement and SUI. It is designed to streamline Move development by providing a simple, lightweight UI packed with feature-rich tools. Much like Remix for Solidity, MovIDE brings a dedicated Move-based IDE to the browser, enabling seamless compiling, building, and deploying of Move packages on-chain. What sets MovIDE apart is its unique ability to load Move packages directly from GitHub or verified on-chains packages into the IDE, facilitating a novel solution for developers aiming to deploy on Movement.

### Compile and Deploy

MovIDE simplifies the process of compiling and deploying Move programs. After loading a program from GitHub or a verified on-chain source, developers can compile the code directly in the IDE. The first compilation may take longer, but subsequent ones will be faster. Once compiled, users can deploy the program on supported networks like Movement M2 or SUI. MovIDE requires a compatible wallet, such as SUI Wallet, for deployment, and supports multiple networks, including devnet, testnet, and mainnet. The IDE also allows developers to configure settings like the path to the Move.toml file for custom builds.
