# Solidity Database

The Solidity Database feature in Solide IDE addresses the problem of siloed source code by ensuring that each contract's source code is openly stored alongside its associated bytecode. This approach does not replace traditional verification processes but rather unifies them, fostering a more collaborative and knowledge-sharing ecosystem around smart contracts.

Unlike existing solutions, which require developers to upload files and relevant settings to verify the contract within the chain's service, the Solidity Database offers a more integrated approach. In the current system, if a contract is deployed and verified on one chain, such as BTTC, but then deployed on another chain like ETH without verification, the contract on ETH remains opaque to developers. However, with Solide IDE or its integration with the Solidity Database, this barrier is removed. By using the bytecode, which remains consistent across chains, the verified source code on BTTC can be linked to the contract on ETH, providing clarity on the previously unverified contract.
