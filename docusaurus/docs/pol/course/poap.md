# Course POAP

PoL POAPs are the rewarding protocol for recognizing achievements on the Proof of Learn platform. Using the *ERC-1155* token standard, each POAP serves as a unique, verifiable badge for learners who complete courses. These tokens are minted on-chain, ensuring permanence and easy verification. Each POAP includes an image and metadata, providing a visual and contextual representation of the learner's accomplishment.

> For a detailed example of a PoL POAP configuration, refer to the [PoL POAP Template](https://github.com/POLearn/pol-template/tree/master/poap)
