# Proof of Learn: Interactive Web3 Learning

Proof of Learn (PoL) is an interactive, blockchain-powered platform redefining Web3 education through hands-on learning. Instead of passive quizzes, PoL immerses users in real-world tasks like deploying smart contracts and completing on-chain transactions, with progress verified directly on-chain. Learners earn blockchain-validated PoL POAP NFTs as tangible proof of their achievements. Built on Open Campus, PoL fosters transparency, collaboration, and open-source innovation, making it the ultimate hub for mastering Web3 concepts across diverse ecosystems.

## How It Works

Proof of Learn transforms blockchain education by integrating open-source resources and interactive experiences into a quest-based learning model. Learners engage directly with underlying chains and smart contracts, completing tasks that generate verifiable on-chain activity. This hands-on approach ensures that every step of the learning journey is transparent, impactful, and directly tied to real-world blockchain interactions.

Our unique questing mechanism not only validates usersâ€™ progress but also supports educators and institutions by recognizing their contributions and providing tools for transparent resource distribution. By equipping learners with verifiable, blockchain-validated credentials, PoL creates new opportunities for students while fostering a more equitable and open education system.
