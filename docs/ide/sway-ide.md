# Swayide

SwayIDE is a specialized Integrated Development Environment designed for developing **Sway** smart contracts on the **Fuel** blockchain. It provides a user-friendly interface that facilitates writing, compiling, and deploying Sway contracts with ease. Featuring integrated support for project management and deployment, SwayIDE streamlines the development workflow, offering tools for real-time code analysis, error checking, and network configuration. With built-in support for various Fuel networks, including devnet, testnet, and mainnet, SwayIDE enhances the efficiency of smart contract development and deployment processes, making it a valuable tool for developers working within the Fuel ecosystem.

### Compile and Deploy

In SwayIDE, compiling and deploying **Sway** smart contracts is straightforward and efficient. After loading your Sway project into the IDE, you can compile your contract with a single click. The compilation process is optimized for rapid feedback, ensuring quick turnaround times for development iterations. Once your contract is successfully compiled, SwayIDE facilitates deployment to any **Fuel** network, including devnet, testnet, or mainnet. Integration with compatible wallets allows for seamless contract deployment and interaction. Additionally, SwayIDE supports configuration of project-specific settings, such as custom paths for the **Forc.toml** file, to tailor the development environment to your needs. This streamlined process helps developers manage and deploy smart contracts efficiently within the Fuel ecosystem.

For testing purposes, you can also interact with your contract by performing a dry run on Fuel by toggling the switch in the IDE, allowing you to simulate contract execution without affecting the live network.
