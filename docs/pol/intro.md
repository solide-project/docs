# Introduction

**Proof of Learn (POL)** is an interactive, blockchain-based learning platform designed to revolutionize Web3 education. By engaging users directly with smart contracts and on-chain transactions, POL shifts the focus from traditional question-answer formats to hands-on learning experiences. Users can complete quests, deploy contracts, and verify their progress through on-chain transaction hashes, earning **POL POAP NFTs** as proof of their achievements.

Built on the **Open Campus** platform, POL emphasizes transparency and open-source collaboration. All resources are available on GitHub, allowing ecosystems and protocols to contribute to the platform. With its focus on verifiable, decentralized education, POL offers a unique and engaging way to learn and master Web3 concepts across multiple blockchains.
